LOG CODE:

# create log here: list or something else mutable.
log

# create function to add an entry to the log

def add_entry:
	wannalog = input("Do you want to log your answer for the future? (y/n)")
	if (wannalog == "y"):
		print("Logging...")
		# put result into records
		print("Logged!")
	else:
		print ("Response discarded.")
	print ("Press space to go again or x to exit! To clear your log, press c.")
# pseudocode, idk the syntax, and does this go in the function add_entry ?
if (space == pressed):
	# call notworking function again
	notworking()
elif (c == pressed):
	# clear entire log (will need another function for this?)
elif (x == pressed):
	# exit whole program

#TODOS: 
# make this into something useful or at least more entertaining
# try to optimize code - there has to be a better way to do this

# it would be cool if there was a log of some sort, of how often you were/weren't procrastinating.
# maybe have an array to keep track of dates as well? (the day and a list of that day's results?) idk really
	# ok so having days sounds hard and I'm going to focus on a list of results for now

# MASTER LIST OF ALL FUNCTIONS because I can't keep track of them:
